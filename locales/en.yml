    main:
      first: Stockflare is an information service. We do not provide advice and do not make recommendations. We are a research tool for self-directed investors.
      fourth: Stockflare's 5 key metrics, are a way to compare the quality of any group of stocks. They look at the profitability, dividends, growth, valuation, and "Wall Street" opinion on any stock. We stress, these are a quality metric and research tool. They are in not an explicit or implicit recommendation.
      second: Stockflare sources its underlying data from Thomson Reuters, one of the world's leading financial data providers.
      third: We present the "Wall Street" consensus forecasts and recommendations on our website. This includes reference to “Buy”, “Sell”, “Hold”, & “Price Targets” for stocks. Like other information services, Stockflare does not endorse these forecasts. Sadly, there is no data on the future. The views of Wall Street are subjective, not objective.
    metrics: The 5 key metrics cover profitability, dividends, growth, valuation, and sentiment. They are not a recommendation but a way to compare the quality of stocks and highlight key risks.
    title: Time for the legals!
    wallStreet: This table presents the upside to the "Wall Street" consensus price target and the consensus recommendation for the stocks in your Watchlist. There is no data on the future. Therefore this consensus is subjective analysis, not objective. Stockflare doesn't endorse the views of "Wall Street". We present this data, so our users can see what the sentiment of the experts is towards any stock.
    worth: This table combines the long-term earnings forecast from the "Wall Street" consensus, the forecast dividend yield and a reversion-to-mean of the forecast PE ratio. Therefore the projected gain figure is based on the subjective analysis of the professionals, and is not objective. Stockflare doesn't endorse the views of "Wall Street". We present this data, so our users can see what the sentiment of the experts is towards a stock. There is no data on the future. If the experts' forecasts are wrong, the actual gain will be materially different to the figures presented here.

Here we show the percentage decrease to the Wall Street Target Price, from today''s stock price. Beware, it''s a subjective option from these experts, not objective. '
      dps: A company pays dividends, like a bank pays interest. The Dividend-per-Share is what you get for each share you own.
      eps: A company’s profit is owned by it’s shareholders. The Earnings-per-Share is what you theoretically earn for each share you have.
      pe: PE ratio shows the share price versus the earnings-per-share. The higher the number the more expensive the stock.
      recommendation: Stockbrokers publish a Buy/ Sell/ Hold recommendation for each stock they analyze. Our data vendor Thomson Reuters calculates the average from these experts. This is a good indicator of "Wall Street's" sentiment. But beware, it's a subjective opinion, not objective.
      upside: 'Stockbrokers publish what they believe is the fair value of a stock, it''s called their Target Price. Our data vendor calculates the average from these experts.
